* **Unlock your iphone**
  * **swipe _-OR-_ pin-code _-OR-_ face-recognition _-OR-_ gesture**
* **With a [Lightning](./images/lightning.jpg) cable, connect your iPhone to your computer**
  * ~~A power-only USB cable will not work (this is only for charging)~~
* **On your iPhone, tap "allow this device to access photos and videos?"**
  * **Select "Allow"**

**On your Computer:**  
* **A Device Ready Notification will open on your computer**
  * **Select it and select "Open Device to view files"**
    * **a new File explorer window will open up**
       _-OR-_
    * **Select the folder that represent your iPhone** (mine "Apple iPhone")  
      * **Select "Internal Storage" folder**
        * **Select [DCIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_rule_for_camera_file_system) folder**
          * **Select "Apple 10#" folder** (older iOS)
           _-OR-_
          * **Select "202110__" folder** (example of new iOS 15.x)
            * **Select each picture with "SHIFT-left-mouse"**
             _-OR-_
            * **Select all pictures with "ctrl-A"**
             _-OR-_
            * **if unselect pictures, use "SHIFT-left-mouse" to toggle** (this is select/unselect)
* **After pictures selected, use "right-mouse-button" to drag files to destination folder**
  * **When "right-mouse-button" released, Select MOVE _-OR-_ COPY _-OR-_ Cancel**
    * **I select/move about 100 pictures at a time** (that amount easy to manage)
    * **Confirm the pictures copied/moved** (before next step, I click first and last Pic to view/check)
* **Unplug the Lightning cable** (same as old/nicer EJECT step)
