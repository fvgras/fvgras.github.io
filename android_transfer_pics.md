* Unlock your Android phone. 
  * with swipe or pin-code
* With a data USB-mini cable, connect your phone to your computer.
  * A power-only USB cable will not work (this is only for charging)
* On your phone, tap to show the notification area
  * Select "Charging this device via USB" notification.
   -OR-
  * Select "Connect as a media device" and "Touch for other USB options"
    * then displays: Media Device (MTP) -- Allows you to transfer media files in Windows, or using Andoid file transfer on a MAC (see www.android.com/filetransfer)
* Under "Use USB for," select File Transfer.
  * It may show a green check box with a check markdown

**On your Computer:**  
* A Device Ready Notification will open on your computer.
  * Select it and select "Open Device to view files" 
    * a new File explorer window will open up
      * Your options are simcard
       -OR-
      * your Device
      * You may have pictures at both storage locations
        * Select **DCIM**  (see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_rule_for_camera_file_system)
          * Select **Camera**
            * Select each picture with **ctrl-left-mouse**
             -OR-
            * Select all pictures with **ctrl-A**
             -OR-
            * **unselect** pictures with **ctrl-left-mouse** (works also)
* After pictures selected, drag files to destination folder with **right-mouse-button**
  * Then released, it will give you option to **MOVE** or **COPY**
    * I move about 100 pictures at a time, because that is manageable
* When you're done, **eject** your phone from Windows.
  * Confirm you have the pictures copied (before you **eject-or-unplug**)
    * if **EJECT** option not available (proceed to next step)
* **Unplug** the USB cable.
