### Cruise Ship Project:
This [project](https://github.com/fvgras/cruise-ship-proj/) is based on Jupyter Notebooks and contains the [data.world](https://data.world) dataset with ship locations from 2003 to mid 2017, with additional city and ship information. This is the capstone Data Science project I selected to reflect different modeling and different predictions.
