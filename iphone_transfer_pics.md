* Unlock your iphone. 
  * with swipe or pin-code or face-recognition
* With a data USB-C cable, connect your iPhone to your computer.
  * A power-only USB cable will not work (this is only for charging)
* On your iPhone, tap "allow this device to access photos and videos?"
  * Select "Allow"

**On your Computer:**  
* A Device Ready Notification will open on your computer.
  * Select it and select "Open Device to view files" 
    * a new File explorer window will open up
      * Select "Internal Storage)
        * Select **DCIM**  (see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_rule_for_camera_file_system)
          * Select **Apple 10x** folder
           _-OR-_
          * Select **202109_**  prefix folder on newer iOS 15.0
            * Select each picture with **ctrl-left-mouse**
             _-OR-_
            * Select all pictures with **ctrl-A**
             _-OR-_
            * **unselect** pictures with **ctrl-left-mouse** (works also)
* After pictures selected, drag files to destination folder with **right-mouse-button**
  * Then released, it will give you option to **MOVE** or **COPY**
    * I move about 100 pictures at a time, because that is manageable
* **Unplug** the USB-C cable.
  * Confirm you have the pictures copied (before you **unplug**)
